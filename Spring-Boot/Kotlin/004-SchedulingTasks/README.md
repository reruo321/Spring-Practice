# Scheduling Tasks
Let's move on to [the second guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/)! This time, we learn
how to build an application with scheduling tasks.

## Objective
We are going to embody a function to the application, which prints out the current time every five seconds.

## Creation
## Test
After finishing the creation, let's run the application!

    ./gradlew bootRun
