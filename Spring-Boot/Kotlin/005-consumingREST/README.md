# Consuming a RESTful Web Service
We will check [the official guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/) to create a REST-consuming application.

## Objective
We are going to build an application to retrieve a random Spring Boot quotation, using RestTemplate. We will fetch the resources from a website!

Since the guide used https://quoters.apps.pcfone.io/api/random, we are going to see how the website works first...

???

I do not think we can test our project with this website... Maybe deprecated?

(I will find alternative and continue)
